        HTML document structure
        <html>
            <head>
                this part of code is not visible on the web page
                <title> here we give title</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                this part of code is visible on the web page
            </body>
        </html>

              heading of the website

            main
              aside(for the links)

        cascading style sheets

        HTML - describe the content
        CSS - visula style and presentation
        CSS consists of countless properties that developers use --> no need to know all the properties


        ðŸ‘‡selector
        h1{
            color: blue;ðŸ‘ˆproperties and value
            text-align: center;
            font-size: 20px;
        }

        IMP NOTE: first include the google fonts and then only include your CSS file
        1. link for the google fonts
        2. link to you CSS file

        IMPORTANT CONCEPTS IN CSS
        1. CSS Inheritance
        2. CSS Box Model

        2 types of elements in HTML
        Block level - which requires the 100% of the width e.g. background-color, h1.
        Inline level - only occupies the space it requires e.g. span, strong, form input element.

        note:- text-align property won't work for inline element (since inline elements take only space it reuires, correct??)
